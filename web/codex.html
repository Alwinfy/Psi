Welcome to <span class='color-thing'>Psi</span>, the greatest spell-program-based magitech mod this side of the universe!<br /><span class='color-thing'>Psi</span> is a mod (inspired by a series called Mahouka) about creating and casting <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span> to do your bidding in the world around you.<br />To begin your journey to become a spellslinging mage, you'll first need some <a href='#psidust'><span class='color-item'>Psidust</span></a>-- however, one does not simply craft the stuff.<br /><br />
Instead, start by crafting a <a href='#cadAssembler'><span class='color-item'>CAD Assembler</span></a> and an <a href='#assembly'><span class='color-item'>Iron CAD Assembly</span></a>.<br />Place the <a href='#cadAssembler'><span class='color-item'>CAD Assembler</span></a>, open it, and insert the <a href='#assembly'><span class='color-item'>Iron CAD Assembly</span></a> to construct a very bare-bones <span class='color-thing'>Casting Assistant Device</span> (<span class='color-thing'>CAD</span>, for short).<br />From there, drop some <span class='color-item'>Redstone Dust</span> on the ground, point your new <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> at the dust, and cast (Right Button) to create some <a href='#psidust'><span class='color-item'>Psidust</span></a>.<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='cadAssembler' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#cadAssembler' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='cadAssembler-fake'>CAD Assembler</b><div class='entry-text'>
The <span class='color-item'>CAD Assembler</span> is the heart of <span class='color-thing'>Psi</span>, serving two essential functions.<br />First, it assembles a <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> from its component parts. Second, it loads <span class='mc-color-o'>non-empty</span> <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullets</span></a> into <span class='color-thing'>CADs</span> (as well as other things that hold <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Bullets</span></a>, such as <a href='#tools'><span class='color-thing'>Psimetal Tools</span></a>).<br /><br />
A <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> is built from up to five components; the simplest <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> only uses one component, an <a href='#assembly'><span class='color-thing'>Assembly</span></a>, though this is only useful for crafting <a href='#psidust'><span class='color-item'>Psidust</span></a>.<br />A <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> capable of casting <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span> requires a <a href='#core'><span class='color-thing'>Core</span></a> and a <a href='#socket'><span class='color-thing'>Socket</span></a> as well.<br />Adding a <a href='#battery'><span class='color-thing'>Battery</span></a> slightly increases a user's maximum <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span>, and adding a <a href='#colorizer'><span class='color-thing'>Colorizer</span></a> changes the color of cast <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span>, which is purely cosmetic.<br /><br />
Once a <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> is created, it can be placed in the leftmost panel of the <span class='color-item'>CAD Assembler</span>.<br />When placed there, the slots below open; <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullets</span></a> can be placed in these slots to be loaded into the <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span>.<br />Once the <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Bullets</span></a> are loaded, the <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> is removed and held, and the <span class='color-thing'>Psi master keybind</span> (c) is held, the <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Bullets</span></a>' <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span> will be displayed on a HUD, ready to be selected and cast.<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='spellProgrammer' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#spellProgrammer' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='spellProgrammer-fake'>Spell Programmer</b><div class='entry-text'>
If the <a href='#cadAssembler'><span class='color-item'>CAD Assembler</span></a> is the heart of <span class='color-thing'>Psi</span>, then the <span class='color-item'>Spell Programmer</span> is the brains of the mod. It's where <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span> are written and compiled, and eventually copied into <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullets</span></a> to be cast.<br />When placed and opened (Right Button), it displays a large 9x9 grid; see <a href='#tutorial1'>the tutorial entries</a> for more in-depth knowledge on using this grid.<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='vectorPrimer' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#vectorPrimer' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='vectorPrimer-fake'>A Primer On Vectors</b><div class='entry-text'>
<span class='color-thing'>Psi</span> uses the concept of a Vector quite extensively. Therefore, if you haven't the foggiest idea what a vector is, I quite strongly recommend you watch the video below.<br />The explanation in the next few pages is <span class='mc-color-l'>simplified</span> for beginners. Don't take it as definitive.<br /><br />
In the world of <span class='color-thing'>Psi</span> (and indeed in a <span class='color-thing'>Minecraft</span> world), all vectors are three-dimensional. In essence, they're just lists of three coordinates: <span class='mc-color-o'>x</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>y</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>z</span>.<br />The <span class='mc-color-o'>x</span>-coordinate represents east when positive and west when negative, the <span class='mc-color-o'>y</span>-direction up and down, and the <span class='mc-color-o'>z</span>-direction south and north.<br />If this doesn't make sense yet, open the debug screen (F3) and run around, paying attention to the row labeled "XYZ:".<br />You'll understand.<br /><br />
That list of three numbers on the debug screen is, in fact, the first type of vector you'll meet: a <span class='mc-color-l'>position vector</span>.<br />A position vector simply represents the location of a block, or an entity, or perhaps some empty space in the world. A single fixed location, represented by a list [<span class='mc-color-o'>x</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>y</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>z</span>].<br />However, not all vectors represent positions-- and it's important to note that <span class='mc-color-l'>any three numbers in a list constitute a vector</span>.<br /><br />
An interesting fact about vectors is that they're extremely easy to add.<br />For example, say we have a grass block at some location, which we choose to represent as [<span class='mc-color-o'>x</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>y</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>z</span>].<br />If we wish to add another vector (e.g. [0, 1, 0]) to this one, all we would have to do is add corresponding numbers:<br />our vector sum would be [<span class='mc-color-o'>x</span>+0, <span class='mc-color-o'>y</span>+1, <span class='mc-color-o'>z</span>+0], or just [<span class='mc-color-o'>x</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>y</span>+1, <span class='mc-color-o'>z</span>].<br /><br />
Since the <span class='mc-color-o'>y</span>-component of our new vector has increased by one, and positive-<span class='mc-color-o'>y</span> means up, this new vector simply represents the block above our grass block.<br />The vector [0, 1, 0] represents the <span class='mc-color-o'>difference</span> in position between our original and new vector, and it's our second type of vector: an <span class='mc-color-l'>offset vector</span>.<br /><br />
Offset vectors are what most spellslingers spend the majority of their time manipulating, so a mastery over them is key.<br />Usually, a mage starts with a single position vector, then adds, subtracts, or otherwise combines offset vectors with this position vector in order to target their desired point in the world.<br /><br />
It's important to note that the idea "offset" and "position" vectors is conceptual; the terms are unique to the terminology of this tablet.<br />Again: all <span class='color-thing'>Psi</span> vectors are just lists of three numbers, and there's nothing stopping you from pretending the distinction doesn't exist.<br />Indeed, in some contexts outside the scope of this book, the distinction doesn't even make <span class='mc-color-o'>sense</span>.<br /><br />
However, <span class='mc-color-o'>within</span> the context of <span class='color-thing'>Psi</span>, putting offset and position vectors where they don't belong can lead to quite unpredictable results indeed.<br />Two rules of thumb:<br /> &bull; Most <span class='color-thing'>Operators</span> that accept vectors should take no more than one position vector;<br /> &bull; Most <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span> that affect blocks should take <span class='mc-color-o'>only</span> a position vector.<br />These are general rules, though; some <span class='color-thing'>Spell Pieces</span> do act differently.<br /><br />
Offset vectors have <span class='mc-color-l'>magnitudes</span>.<br />You can think of an offset vector's magnitude as its "length," or the distance between a position in the world, and that same position when the offset vector is added to it.<br />For example, our earlier offset vector [0, 1, 0] simply moved the position one block-length up, so it had a length, and therefore a magnitude, of 1.<br /><br />
Since a distance is always positive, so are vectors' magnitudes.<br />Consider the vector [0, -3, 0] as an example: it represents down, three blocks-- yet the total distance moved is three blocks, and the "down" bit doesn't matter.<br />Therefore, the magnitude of this vector is <span class='mc-color-l'>positive</span> 3.<br /><br />
Magnitudes are a bit harder to calculate for vectors that <span class='mc-color-o'>aren't</span> mostly zeroes.<br />However, since the <span class='mc-color-o'>x</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>y</span>, and <span class='mc-color-o'>z</span> directions are all at right angles, we can actually use the well-known Pythagorean Theorem to calculate any vector's magnitude.<br />In particular, the magnitude for a vector [<span class='mc-color-o'>p</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>q</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>r</span>] is the number √(<span class='mc-color-o'>p</span>²+<span class='mc-color-o'>q</span>²+<span class='mc-color-o'>r</span>²).<br /><br />
For example, the magnitude of the vector [3, -4, 0] is √(3²+(-4)²+0²), which comes out to exactly 5.<br />(Most of the time, a vector magnitude doesn't come out to a whole number, though.)<br />Note that, while you <span class='mc-color-o'>can</span> find the magnitude of a position vector, the number you get is largely meaningless-- who <span class='mc-color-o'>cares</span> about your distance from [0, 0, 0] (which is some arbitrary point near bedrock and world spawn)?<br /><br />
Almost all vectors also have <span class='mc-color-l'>directions</span>.<br />An offset vector's direction is, well, the direction something would move if it followed the vector in a straight line.<br />For example, the direction of [0, 1, 0] is simply straight up.<br />The vector [1, 0, -1], on the other hand, represents one block east and one block north, so its direction is just straight ahead, due northeast.<br /><br />
(Most directions aren't so nice, usually looking like "36.86 degrees north of west, 22.62 degrees below the horizon.")<br />Note that the only vector without a direction is [0, 0, 0] (the <span class='mc-color-l'>zero vector</span>), since you have to be going somewhere <span class='mc-color-o'>else</span> to have a direction.<br />Note that the direction of a position vector is almost as meaningless as its magnitude-- most <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span> don't need to know "where should I go to get away from bedrock at world spawn."<br /><br />
As a matter of fact, you can reconstruct any vector, given only its magnitude and direction, into a list of three numbers (which are known as the <span class='mc-color-l'>components</span> of the vector).<br />For example, the direction "up" and the magnitude 1 correspond to the vector [0, 1, 0].<br />This isn't as surprising as it may seem: after all, if someone tells you which direction to go, and how far, you should know they want you to be.<br /><br />
There are several simple ways to manipulate position and offset vectors.<br />First, we can add a position and an offset vector to get another position vector, as we did earlier with the grass block example.<br />On the other hand, we can of course <span class='mc-color-o'>subtract</span> two position vectors to get the offset vector representing the offset from one to the other:<br />[<span class='mc-color-o'>x</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>y</span>+1, <span class='mc-color-o'>z</span>] − [<span class='mc-color-o'>x</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>y</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>z</span>] = [0, 1, 0].<br /><br />
Perhaps more interestingly, we can add two offset vectors, to get a single offset representing their combination.<br />Adding this offset to a position vector would be equivalent to first adding one of its components to that position vector, then adding the other.<br /><br />
And last, but most certainly not least, of the simple operations: we can <span class='mc-color-l'>scale</span> a vector, by multiplying it by a number.<br />Note that we're multiplying it by a number, and <span class='mc-color-o'>not</span> another vector.<br />If we wish to scale an vector [<span class='mc-color-o'>p</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>q</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>r</span>] by a factor <span class='mc-color-o'>n</span>, we simply multiply each of the vector's components by <span class='mc-color-o'>n</span>:<br /><span class='mc-color-o'>n</span>·[<span class='mc-color-o'>p</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>q</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>r</span>] = [<span class='mc-color-o'>n</span>·<span class='mc-color-o'>p</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>n</span>·<span class='mc-color-o'>q</span>, <span class='mc-color-o'>n</span>·<span class='mc-color-o'>r</span>].<br /><br />
This final operation actually relates quite nicely indeed to the concepts of magnitude and direction.<br />When you scale a vector by a number <span class='mc-color-o'>n</span>, you:<br /> &bull; multiply its magnitude by the absolute value of <span class='mc-color-o'>n</span>, and<br /> &bull; don't change its direction if <span class='mc-color-o'>n</span> is positive, but reverse its direction if <span class='mc-color-o'>n</span> is negative.<br />If <span class='mc-color-o'>n</span>=0, then of course the resulting vector is the zero vector.<br /><br />
If, on the other hand, we set <span class='mc-color-o'>n</span>=-1, then we get a vector with the same magnitude (since the absolute value of -1 is 1), but that points in the opposite direction (since -1 is negative).<br />This vector is known as the <span class='mc-color-l'>negative</span> of the original, and when the two are added we get the zero vector.<br />This makes sense, since if we go in a direction, then go in the opposite direction for the same distance, our net movement is zero.<br /><br />
If, instead of multiplying, we <span class='mc-color-o'>divide</span> a (nonzero) vector by its magnitude, we get a vector with magnitude 1 (since anything divided by itself is 1), but the same direction (since magnitudes are always positive).<br />This is an important and well-known operation, known as <span class='mc-color-l'>normalizing</span> a vector; the vector that results (and, in fact, any vector with magnitude 1) is called a <span class='mc-color-l'>unit vector</span>.<br /><br />
Unit vectors have a fixed magnitude, so they only really represent direction.<br />Many <span class='color-thing'>Spell Pieces</span> related to direction return unit vectors, like <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Vector Axis Raycast</span> and <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Entity Look</span>.<br />Indeed, there are <span class='color-thing'>Operators</span> to do <span class='mc-color-o'>most</span> of the vector operations laid out in this article, usually with self-explanatory names.<br /><br />
The operations and their corresponding <span class='color-thing'>Operators</span> are as follows:<br /> &bull; Negating is <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Vector Negate</span>;<br /> &bull; Normalizing is <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Vector Normalize</span>;<br /> &bull; Scaling is <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Vector Multiply</span> and <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Vector Divide</span>;<br /> &bull; Taking the magnitude is <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Vector Magnitude</span>;<br /> &bull; Adding is <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Vector Sum</span>;<br /> &bull; Subtracting is <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Vector Subtract</span>.<br /><br />
Finally: vectors are still lists of three numbers. Don't lose sight of that.<br />In a <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Spell Programmer</span></a>, they can be constructed from up to three numbers with <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Vector Construct</span>.<br />Conversely, a vector can also be broken back down into numbers with <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Extract X</span>, <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Extract Y</span>, and <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Extract Z</span>.<br /><br />
Congratulations on making it through this tutorial!<br />Again, this is just an introduction to vectors-- I've not said anything about dot or cross products, or vector projections, for example.<br />But this should be more than enough to put together some quite interesting spells already.<br />That's all-- now go forth and spellsling!<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='tutorial1' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#tutorial1' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='tutorial1-fake'>Tutorial (1): Writing A Spell</b><div class='entry-text'>
Congratulations on getting acquainted with your brand-new <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span>!<br />This tablet will serve as a reference manual for this mod, but certain entries (like this one) are tutorials, introducing you to the concepts and terms of a proper spellslinger.<br />Don't worry, this is the longest tutorial, as it covers all the basics.<br /><br />
<span class='mc-color-o'>Note that many keywords in <span class='color-item'>colored</span> <span class='mc-color-b'>text</span> are links, and can be clicked on to learn more about their respective items or concepts.</span><br />To get started with spell programming, you'll need (duh) a <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Spell Programmer</span></a>.<br />Additionally, to actually execute your <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span>, you'll need a better <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> than the one you have right now-- you can construct one in your <a href='#cadAssembler'><span class='color-item'>CAD Assembler</span></a>.<br /><br />
To that end, you probably want to make a <a href='#core'><span class='color-item'>Basic CAD Core</span></a> and <a href='#socket'><span class='color-item'>Basic CAD Socket</span></a>.<br />You don't have to make another <a href='#assembly'><span class='color-thing'>Assembly</span></a>; you can put your current <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> in a crafting grid to revert it back to one (since it's pretty much just an <a href='#assembly'><span class='color-thing'>Assembly</span></a> anyway).<br />Additionally, <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span> can't be cast directly out of a <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span>; instead they're stored in <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullets</span></a>, so to get rolling you'll need a small handful of those as well.<br /><br />
Once all your materials are gathered, the standard workflow for <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> creation goes as follows:<br /> &bull; Construct a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> in the <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Programmer</span></a>;<br /> &bull; Copy the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> into a <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullet</span></a>;<br /> &bull; Load the <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullet</span></a> into your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> using the <a href='#cadAssembler'><span class='color-item'>CAD Assembler</span></a>;<br /> &bull; Hold your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span>, point, and cast.<br />In this tutorial and the next, we'll walk you through this process.<br /><br />
When you open up your <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Spell Programmer</span></a>, you'll see a large grid-- this is where <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span> are made, and where the magic happens.<br /><span class='color-thing'>Psi</span>'s programming system isn't <span class='mc-color-o'>quite</span> a traditional, complex one; instead, <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span> are composed of simple actions, called <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span>, executed in order.<br />The whole mod centers around simply getting <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span> to do what you want them to.<br /><br />
<span class='color-thing'>Psi</span>'s <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span> are all created on the <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Programmer</span></a>'s grid from <span class='color-thing'>Spell Pieces</span>; you can add as many pieces of as many types to a grid as you want, though not all arrangements of <span class='color-thing'>Spell Pieces</span> will produce valid <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span>.<br />To add a piece to the grid, right-click where you want the piece to go, and select from the menu of pieces that pops up.<br /><br />
When selecting from the menu of <span class='color-thing'>Spell Pieces</span>, you can hover over one to see its name, and click on it to place it in the grid.<br />Don't worry about the myriad of pieces that appear for you; you can simply type to search for specific pieces, and press Enter to place the first search result.<br />You can hold Shift and hover over the "?" button on the bottom-right to see the full list of shortcuts.<br /><br />
Start by placing the piece called <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Debug</span> anywhere on the grid.<br />As mentioned before, <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span> like this one are the <span class='color-thing'>Spell Pieces</span> responsible for interacting with the world.<br />This is the simplest <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span>; all it does is say something in your chat. Yet <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span> can use your <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span> to do a huge variety of things.<br /><br />
Select a grid piece <span class='mc-color-l'>adjacent</span> to your <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Debug</span>, and place the piece called <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Caster</span> there.<br /><span class='color-thing'>Selectors</span> are the <span class='color-thing'>Spell Pieces</span> that provide information about the surrounding world to <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span>.<br />This particular piece represents you, the eventual caster of this <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>. You'll probably use this one quite often, as it's a natural starting-point for your <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span>.<br /><br />
Nearly all <span class='color-thing'>Spell Pieces</span> need <span class='mc-color-l'>parameters</span>, which tell the pieces what to perform their actions on.<br />For example, we know that <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Debug</span> sends something to chat; its first parameter tells it <span class='mc-color-o'>what</span> to say.<br /><span class='mc-color-o'>Parameters also have <span class='mc-color-l'>data types</span></span><span class='mc-color-o'>, or <span class='mc-color-l'>types</span><span class='mc-color-o'> for short, but we'll worry about those in a later tutorial.</span></span><br /><br />
Left-click your <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Debug</span> piece; you should see a panel appear on the left-hand side with two rows. Each row should have a label and several small arrows.<br />These two rows represent the two parameters that <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Debug</span> takes.<br />Ignore the row labeled "Number" for now; just know that the dot in the center means it's optional. For a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> to function, all <span class='mc-color-o'>non</span>-optional parameters must be filled.<br /><br />
Look at the arrows labeled "Target," and select the one corresponding to where you placed <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Caster</span> (for example, if you placed it to the right of <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Debug</span>, select the rightmost arrow that points left), so it appears that the <span class='color-thing'>Selector</span> piece is pointing towards the <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span> piece.<br /><br />
This will make the <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span> use the <span class='color-thing'>Selector</span> as its "Target" parameter.<br />We say that <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Debug</span> <span class='mc-color-l'>accepts</span> or <span class='mc-color-l'>takes</span> <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Caster</span> as its "Target" parameter.<br />Parameters are also known as <span class='mc-color-l'>arguments</span>, or simply <span class='mc-color-l'>inputs</span>.<br /><span class='mc-color-o'>Technical note: In programming-vocabulary there's a subtle difference in the terms, but it's beyond the scope of this tablet.</span><br /><br />
At this point, the X in the upper-left hand corner of the <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Programmer</span></a> should have turned into a check-mark.<br />A check-mark means that the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> <span class='mc-color-l'>compiled successfully</span> (which is a compact way of saying "the <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Programmer</span></a> made sure that all the <span class='color-thing'>Spell Pieces</span> you've placed fit together correctly"). <br /><br />
If at any time the X is present (which means that the compilation <span class='mc-color-l'>failed</span> or <span class='mc-color-l'>errored</span>), you can hover over it to see the problem with your <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> and correct that problem.<br />Once your <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> compiles successfully, it can be copied into a <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullet</span></a> and cast. And that's exactly what we'll do in <a href='#tutorial2'>the next tutorial</a>!<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='tutorial2' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#tutorial2' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='tutorial2-fake'>Tutorial (2): Casting A Spell</b><div class='entry-text'>
So, you've written your first <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>! Actually casting it, though, will take a few extra steps.<br />First, close out your <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Spell Programmer</span></a>, hold a <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullet</span></a> (which you should have prepared in the last tutorial), and use (Right Button) the bullet on the Programmer. You should hear a chime, and the bullet should rename itself to "Debug."<br /><br />
The bullet now contains a copy of the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> you've written, and is ready to be loaded into your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span>.<br />To load a <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullet</span></a> into your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span>, open your <a href='#cadAssembler'><span class='color-item'>CAD Assembler</span></a> and insert your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> into the leftmost slot. Some of the slots below it should open; place the bullet with the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> you've written in one of these slots. Take your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> back out.<br /><br />
<span class='color-thing'>CADs</span> can hold multiple <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullets</span></a>, and therefore multiple <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span>; the active <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> to be cast can be switched on-the-fly.<br />To select a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> to cast, hold your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> in either hand and hold down the <span class='color-thing'>Psi master keybind</span> (c).<br />A HUD should appear; hover over the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> labeled "Debug" (the one you just wrote) and release the key to select it.<br /><br />
When you cast the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> (Right Button), you should see displayed in chat a long block of text that includes your username and coordinates. If so: congratulations! You've managed to write and cast your first <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>!<br />If you need to craft more <a href='#psidust'><span class='color-item'>Psidust</span></a>, re-open the HUD and select a slot without a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> stored, then cast at <span class='color-item'>Redstone Dust</span> as you normally would.<br /><br />
<span class='mc-color-l'>A sidenote: you should carry only one <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> at a time.</span><br />If more than one is carried, their channeled <span class='color-thing'>Psi</span> energies interfere, shorting out any <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span> cast. This phenomenon, known as "cast jamming," is best avoided by simply keeping to one-<span class='color-thing'>CAD</span>-per-mage.<br />Once you've successfully cast your Debug <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>, you can move on to <a href='#tutorial3'>the next tutorial</a>.<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='tutorial3' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#tutorial3' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='tutorial3-fake'>Tutorial (3): Types & Numbers</b><div class='entry-text'>
Open up your <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Spell Programmer</span></a> and take a look at your "Debug" <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> again.<br />Remember the "Number" parameter on <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Debug</span> that we saw in <a href='#tutorial1'>the first tutorial</a>? We mentioned previously that that parameter has an extra dot in the center, meaning it can be disabled. But this time, we <span class='mc-color-o'>won't</span> disable it.<br /><br />
The "Number" parameter of <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Debug</span>, when used, is printed as a label of sorts, so that multiple copies of <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Debug</span> in a complex <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> can be differentiated.<br />The <span class='mc-color-l'>type</span> of this parameter is "Number," which means that the parameter will only accept arguments that output (or <span class='mc-color-l'>return</span>) Numbers.<br />The first parameter, "Target," accepts the special type "Any," which means it can accept anything.<br /><br />
If you hold Shift and hover over a Spell Piece, it'll tell you the types of all its parameters, as well as its output's type. For example, we can see that the <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Caster</span> piece returns an Entity, which isn't a Number. So we'll need some other piece to represent one.<br /><br />
Choose an empty grid piece adjacent to <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Debug</span>, and place the piece called <span class='mc-color-b'>Constant: Number</span>.<br />If you Shift-hover over this piece, you'll see that it <span class='mc-color-o'>does</span> return a Number (actually, it returns a Number Constant, which is a Number but more specific).<br />Therefore, if you left-click your <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Debug</span> again and point its Number parameter at the <span class='mc-color-b'>Constant: Number</span>, your <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> should compile.<br /><br />
To run your new-and-improved Debug <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>, you might believe that you need to unload the bullet, re-copy the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>, reload the bullet, and re-select the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>.<br />Luckily, your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> comes with a shortcut: simply select your Debug <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> on your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> and swipe (Right Button) your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> over your <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Programmer</span></a>, and the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> stored in the corresponding bullet will update itself to the <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Programmer</span></a>'s version.<br /><br />
If you cast your Debug <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> now, you'll notice that you get the same long block of text as before, but with a bracketed zero in front: in fact, the same zero that was displayed in the <span class='mc-color-b'>Constant: Number</span> piece when you placed it.<br />So the logical next question is: How do we display a number <span class='mc-color-o'>other</span> than zero?<br /><br />
Well, the <span class='mc-color-b'>Constant: Number</span> piece is special: to set its stored constant, all you have to do is select the piece and simply type a new number.<br />All other <span class='color-thing'>Spell Pieces</span> are configured only from the left-hand parameter panel.<br /><span class='mc-color-o'>Technical wayside: all Number Constants count as Numbers, but plain Numbers don't count as Number Constants. Only <span class='color-thing'>Constant</span> <span class='color-thing'>Spell Pieces</span> return Number Constants.</span><br /><br />
Try editing the number stored in the <span class='mc-color-b'>Constant: Number</span>, updating the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> stored in your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span>, and re-casting. You should see that the prefixed number has, in fact, changed! Neat!<br /><br />
Now, here's the thing: we've hooked <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Debug</span> up to two different inputs at once.<br />Truth be told, <span class='mc-color-o'>most</span> <span class='color-thing'>Spell Pieces</span> take two (or even three) inputs. And when it comes right down to it, your <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>'s inputs might end up adjacent to one another.<br />That's where <span class='mc-color-b'>Connectors</span> come in.<br /><br />
Connectors are simple pieces, yet powerful: They take one input, of any type, and return that same input. Thus, if a certain <span class='color-thing'>Spell Piece</span> requires as input another piece that's two grid-spaces away, you can connect them with a <span class='mc-color-b'>Connector</span>.<br /><br />
Of course, the true power of a <span class='mc-color-b'>Connector</span> is that they can connect to each <span class='mc-color-o'>other</span>: so you can of course daisy-chain them together to connect <span class='color-thing'>Spell Pieces</span> from as far-away as you please.<br />Play around with some <span class='mc-color-b'>Connectors</span>, and as soon as you feel comfortable with them you can move on to <a href='#tutorial5'>the next tutorial</a>!<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='tutorial4' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#tutorial4' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='tutorial4-fake'>Tutorial (4): Move It</b><div class='entry-text'>
Okay, okay. I know what you're thinking: "This is boring. When do we start doing cool stuff?" Well... now!<br />Let's introduce a <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span> that actually interacts with the world-- introducing: <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Add Motion</span>.<br />This trick takes an entity, and adds motion to it (i.e. gives it a push) in a certain direction.<br /><br />
Examples of entities include: you, the caster; a chicken; a zombie; a minecart; a falling sand block; an arrow; the Wither.<br />This <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span> takes as parameters an Entity (which represents the entity to move), a Vector (the direction to push it in), and a Number Constant (how hard the <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span> should push the entity).<br /><span class='mc-color-o'>Note: If you don't understand what the word "vector" means, <a href='#vectorPrimer'>this entry</a> should serve as a good introduction.</span><br /><br />
Let's write a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> that, when cast, simply boosts its caster forwards, using <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Add Motion</span>.<br />As mentioned before, <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Caster</span> returns an Entity (namely: you, the caster), so we can use that as the first parameter to <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Add Motion</span>.<br />We'd like the trick to boost you <span class='mc-color-o'>forward</span>-- that is, <span class='mc-color-o'>in the direction you're looking</span>. To do that, let's introduce our next piece: <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Entity Look</span>.<br /><br />
No <span class='color-thing'>Operator</span> pieces change the world around them in any way, nor do they pull information from it (with a few exceptions). Instead, they merely <span class='mc-color-o'>transform</span> information into more useful forms.<br />In particular, <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Entity Look</span> accepts an Entity, and returns a unit Vector: the direction the Entity is looking.<br />Thus, one of these, hooked up to a <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Caster</span>, will return a Vector that points wherever you're looking at.<br /><br />
Finally, for the last parameter of <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Add Motion</span>, a simple <span class='mc-color-b'>Constant: Number</span> will do.<br />Let's put this <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> all together: first, open up your <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Spell Programmer</span></a> and clear any <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> currently on it. Then, place a <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Add Motion</span> near the middle of the grid.<br /><br />
Place a <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Caster</span> directly above the <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span>, an <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Entity Look</span> to its right, and a <span class='mc-color-b'>Constant: Number</span> to its left.<br />Fill in a value for the <span class='color-thing'>Constant</span> (I recommend the number 3).<br />Place a <span class='mc-color-b'>Connector</span> between the <span class='color-thing'>Operator</span> and the <span class='color-thing'>Selector</span>, and then set up all the parameters for the <span class='color-thing'>Operator</span> and <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span> so the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> compiles-- it should look something like the image on the next page.<br /><br />
Copy the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> into your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span>, look straight ahead, and cast. If you get thrown forward, then congratulations! You've just finished writing your first real <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>!<br /><span class='mc-color-o'>Note: Casting your new <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> too many times in a row might be bad for your health. More on this in <a href='#tutorial5'>the next tutorial</a>.</span><br /><br />
</div><br><span id='tutorial5' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#tutorial5' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='tutorial5-fake'>Tutorial (5): Limits</b><div class='entry-text'>
Open your <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Spell Programmer</span></a> again, and review the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> you wrote in <a href='#tutorial4'>the last tutorial</a>.<br />When it compiled correctly, you should have seen five icons appear to the right of the grid, each with two numbers. These numerical stats define the practical limits on exactly what <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span> you're able to cast.<br /><br />
The stats for your Add Motion <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> (assuming your constant was 3)<br /><br />
The first stat is <span class='color-thing'>Complexity</span>, the total number of <span class='color-thing'>Operators</span>, <span class='color-thing'>Selectors</span>, and non-debug <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span> in the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>.<br />Its maximum value is determined by the <a href='#core'><span class='color-thing'>CAD Core</span></a> you have installed; if a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>'s <span class='color-thing'>Complexity</span> exceeds your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span>'s capacity, it won't be castable.<br /><br />
The second is <span class='color-thing'>Potency</span>, capped by your <a href='#assembly'><span class='color-thing'>Assembly</span></a> component; the approximate total power draw of all <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span> used in the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>.<br />Some <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span> have a fixed <span class='color-thing'>Potency</span> cost per-use. However, most <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span> that have a Number Constant-type parameter use it to determine their <span class='color-thing'>Potency</span>; the higher the constant, the greater the <span class='color-thing'>Potency</span>.<br /><br />
The third stat, <span class='color-thing'>Cost</span>, is unique in that your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> sets no limits on it. Instead, each time a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> is cast, it consumes its <span class='color-thing'>Cost</span> from your own body's <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span>.<br />The first number shown is the <span class='mc-color-o'>ideal</span> <span class='color-thing'>Cost</span> of the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>-- all <a href='#assembly'><span class='color-thing'>CAD Assemblies</span></a> have flaws that increase it.<br /><br />
The true <span class='color-thing'>Cost</span> of casting with your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> is the parenthesized number on the <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Programmer</span></a> display, and the higher an <a href='#assembly'><span class='color-thing'>Assembly</span></a>'s <span class='color-thing'>Efficiency</span>, the closer to ideal the actual <span class='color-thing'>Cost</span> of casting from your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> becomes.<br /><br />
Your <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span> regenerates at around 500 units per second, limiting the speed at which you can cast <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span>.<br />Your current level of <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span> can be accessed from within a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> with <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Caster Energy</span>.<br /><br />
Note that if you cast a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> without enough <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span> available (known as <span class='mc-color-l'>overdrawing</span>), your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> will draw the excess cost from your own health, and promptly disable itself until your <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span> fully regenerates, for your own protection.<br />A <a href='#battery'><span class='color-thing'>Battery</span></a> added to a <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> can guard against this.<br />Be careful-- overdrawing has consequences that are painful, and maybe even lethal!<br /><br />
The fourth stat displayed on the <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Programmer</span></a> is <span class='color-thing'>Projection</span>: the total number of non-debug <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span> in the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>.<br />Your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span>'s <a href='#core'><span class='color-thing'>Core</span></a> determines your maximum <span class='color-thing'>Projection</span> per-<span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>; too many tricks and the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> is uncastable.<br /><br />
And the fifth and final stat is <span class='color-thing'>Bandwidth</span>, capped by your <a href='#socket'><span class='color-thing'>CAD Socket</span></a>: the width or height of the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>, measured in grid spaces-- whichever is larger.<br />This is, with a bit of ingenuity, one of the more interesting stats to work with; if your <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> is too big, the technique of moving some pieces around and eliminating others to pack it into a smaller space is known as <span class='mc-color-l'>compression</span>.<br /><br />
There's one final limitation on <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span>: no <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span> can affect anything more than 32 blocks away from its <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Focal Point</span></a> (for a plain <a href='#basicBullet'><span class='color-item'>Spell Bullet</span></a>, that's just you, the caster), excepting the caster of the spell themself.<br />A <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> that attempts to do so will display an error in chat, then <span class='mc-color-l'>fizzle</span>.<br />When a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> fizzles, it harmlessly disperses its stored <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span>, and any remaining <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span> it would otherwise execute don't happen.<br /><br />
To clarify the earlier exception mentioned:<br />Certain types of <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullets</span></a> have <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Focal Points</span></a> that <span class='mc-color-o'>aren't</span> their casters-- yet in these cases, their stored <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span> can still affect their casters through <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Caster</span>, no matter how far away their <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Focal Points</span></a> are.<br />There's <a href='#tutorial6'>one final tutorial</a> lined up, putting most of what we've learned together, and then we'll cut you loose into the wider world of <span class='color-thing'>Psi</span>. Good luck!<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='tutorial6' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#tutorial6' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='tutorial6-fake'>Tutorial (6): EXPLOSION</b><div class='entry-text'>
Do you like explosions?<br />Of course you do. Everyone loves explosions!<br />So let's make a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> that blows up whatever you're looking at when you cast it.<br />What could possibly go wrong?<br /><br />
To write this <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>, let's start with the <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span> we'll use to cause an explosion, and work backwards.<br />Conveniently, it's named <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Explode</span>-- so open up your <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Spell Programmer</span></a>, clear out the grid, and place a <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Explode</span> near the middle.<br />Shift-hovering over it reveals that it accepts a Vector and a Number Constant as parameters.<br /><br />
The Number Constant parameter represents the explosion's power-- easy enough to fill with a <span class='mc-color-b'>Constant: Number</span> piece.<br />The Vector, on the other hand, accepts the position vector of the location you want the explosion to go off at. This is what'll take a bit more effort to calculate.<br /><br />
<a href='#tutorial5'>Last tutorial</a>, we used <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Entity Look</span>.<br />However, that <span class='color-thing'>Operator</span> returns a unit vector, and <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Explode</span> needs a position, so feeding that piece directly into the <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span> would probably not produce the results we want.<br />So let's introduce another <span class='color-thing'>Operator</span>: namely, <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Entity Position</span>.<br /><br />
<span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Entity Position</span> accepts an Entity (like the caster of the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>), and returns that entity's position (to be more precise: for a player like you, it returns your position at eye-level).<br />However, we don't want to pass this directly into <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Explode</span>, either-- because it would quite literally explode in your face when cast.<br /><br />
What we <span class='mc-color-o'>could</span> do here is simply scale up the vector we got from <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Entity Look</span> by a factor of, say, 10, and then add this to <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Entity Position</span>'s output.<br />When fed into <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Explode</span>, this would create a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> that, when cast, would create an explosion <span class='mc-color-o'>exactly ten blocks away from you, in the direction you're looking</span>.<br /><br />
But the limitations of this <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> seem obvious: if you want to blow something up that's closer or further than ten blocks away, you'll have to do some awkward moving-around and guesstimating of distances.<br />Not very practical, all things considered.<br />Instead, let's use a smarter operator: <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Vector Raycast</span>.<br /><br />
This <span class='color-thing'>Operator</span>'s function is quite simple, intuitively; it accepts a position vector and a "ray" vector (which is just a vector to represent direction).<br />Its return value pretty much represents "if I stood there and looked in that direction, what position would I be looking at?", which makes it perfect for our purposes.<br />For more details, including what the "Max" argument does, read the page about <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Vector Raycast</span>.<br /><br />
So! To build this <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>, let's work backwards.<br />If you haven't done so already, place a <span class='mc-color-b'>Constant: Number</span> near the <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Explode</span> (if you're still using the <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> you built in <a href='#tutorial1'>the first tutorial</a>, 1.4 would be a good number to set it to).<br />Then, place a <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Vector Raycast</span> next to the <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span> as well, and hook the <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span> up to the other two <span class='color-thing'>Spell Pieces</span>.<br /><br />
Next, place an <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Entity Position</span> and an <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Entity Look</span>, then connect your <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Vector Raycast</span> to the two.<br />Make sure to hook "Position" up to Entity Position and "Ray" up to Entity Look, and not the other way around, or else you'll get some odd results/errors when you cast the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>.<br />Finally, place a <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Caster</span>, and hook this up to the two Entity operators.<br /><br />
Once your <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> compiles successfully, load it into your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span>, take careful aim at something (preferably something you don't care much about), and cast.<br />If that thing you're looking at explodes, take a moment to savor your newfound power.<br />Just, er, try not to cast it at your own two feet.<br /><br />
One final note: Try casting your new "Explode" <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> at something that's more than 32 blocks away (or at nothing, like the sky).<br />You should see no explosion, and an error should pop up in chat, telling you "<span class='mc-color-c'>Spell Target is outside maximum 32 block radius.</span>" (this limit was discussed last tutorial).<br />These sorts of errors popping up in chat can get rather annoying.<br /><br />
To fix this, simply place an <span class='mc-color-b'>Error Suppressor</span> piece anywhere on the grid, and the resulting <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> will instead fail silently, when cast.<br />You might want to remove the piece when debugging, though. Errors <span class='mc-color-o'>can</span> be useful sometimes.<br /><br />
This concludes this set of tutorials!<br />Have a read through the rest of this book for an idea of exactly what you can do with this mod. Experienced mages can do quite terrifying things, after all.<br />It's up to you to experiment with your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> and <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Spell Programmer</span></a>, and to create your own unique <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span>.<br />Good luck, and welcome to the wide world of <span class='color-thing'>Psi</span>!<br /><br />

Nearly all <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span> execute simultaneously with the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> containing them. Nonetheless, to use <span class='mc-color-b'>flow control tricks</span>, you'll need a basic knowledge of evaluation order; that is, the order that <span class='color-thing'>Spell Pieces</span> get evaluated in.<br /><br />
There are three basic rules to evaluation order; they're explained in more detail in the following pages, but a brief summary follows:<br /> &bull; When a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> is executed, its <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span> are each evaluated (and then executed) left-to-right, then top-to-bottom;<br /> &bull; Any <span class='color-thing'>Spell Piece</span> being evaluated will evaluate all of its inputs first;<br /> &bull; A <span class='color-thing'>Spell Piece</span> is evaluated at most once per <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> execution, when its value is first required.<br /><br />
The first rule should be rather self-explanatory: a <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span> placed higher on the grid is executed earlier than a <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span> placed lower, and when two or more <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span> are in the same row, the leftmost one executes first.<br />Thus, the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> shown on the next page should display "1.0", "2.0", "3.0", and "4.0" in chat, in that exact order.<br /><br />
The second rule is just as simple; a <span class='color-thing'>Spell Piece</span> is only evaluated when its value is required.<br />However, notably, the converse is <span class='mc-color-o'>also</span> true-- namely: if a <span class='color-thing'>Spell Piece</span> <span class='mc-color-o'>isn't</span> required for a <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span>, directly or indirectly, it's never evaluated when the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> executes.<br />Any <span class='color-thing'>Spell Piece</span> that isn't connected to a <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span> causes <span class='mc-color-l'>undefined behavior</span>-- no guarantees on <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> behavior exist in these cases.<br /><br />
The third and final rule is a bit more subtle, and is best illustrated in the spell on the next page:<br />A <span class='color-thing'>Spell Piece</span> only evaluates once, and returns <span class='mc-color-o'>the exact same value</span> for subsequent evaluations. Therefore, the four copies of <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Debug</span> displayed will all output the <span class='mc-color-o'>same</span> number, since the <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Random</span> only gets evaluated once.<br /><span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Evaluate</span> can be used to evaluate a <span class='color-thing'>Spell Piece</span> "early."<br /><br />

The ingredients for other types of <span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullets</span> are as follows:<br /> &bull; a <a href='#projectileBullet'><span class='color-item'>Projectile Spell Bullet</span></a> needs some kind of <span class='color-item'>Arrow</span>,<br /> &bull; a <a href='#loopcastBullet'><span class='color-item'>Loopcast Spell Bullet</span></a> needs a piece of <span class='color-item'>String</span>,<br /> &bull; a <a href='#circleBullet'><span class='color-item'>Circle Spell Bullet</span></a> needs, well, something circular (a <span class='color-item'>Snowball</span> or a <span class='color-item'>Slimeball</span>),<br /> &bull; a <a href='#grenadeBullet'><span class='color-item'>Grenade Spell Bullet</span></a> needs a piece of <span class='color-item'>Gunpowder</span>,<br /> &bull; a <a href='#chargeBullet'><span class='color-item'>Charge Spell Bullet</span></a> needs a piece of <span class='color-item'>Redstone Dust</span>, and<br /> &bull; a <a href='#mineBullet'><span class='color-item'>Mine Spell Bullet</span></a> needs some kind of <span class='color-item'>Button</span>.<br /><br />
Before a <span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullet</span> can be loaded into a <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span>, it needs to have a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> stored on it.<br />To store a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> on a <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Spell Programmer</span></a> in a <span class='color-thing'>Bullet</span>, just swipe the <span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullet</span> over the <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Programmer</span></a> (Right Button).<br />A <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> stored in a <span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullet</span> can be copied into an empty <a href='#spellDrive'><span class='color-item'>Spell Drive</span></a> in a crafting grid for storage purposes.<br /><br />
A <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Spell Programmer</span></a> displays a <a href='#tutorial5'><span class='color-thing'>Cost</span></a> for any <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> it compiles successfully-- yet for different types of <span class='color-thing'>Bullets</span>, this <a href='#tutorial5'><span class='color-thing'>Cost</span></a> can be different.<br />The <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Programmer</span></a>'s value is calibrated to the most basic type of <span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullet</span>, (somewhat confusingly) just called the <a href='#basicBullet'><span class='color-item'>Spell Bullet</span></a>.<br /><br />
All other types of <span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullet</span> display a <span class='color-thing'>Cost Multiplier</span> in percentage, which can simply be multiplied by the cost displayed on the <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Programmer</span></a> to determine the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>'s true <a href='#tutorial5'><span class='color-thing'>Cost</span></a> for that <span class='color-thing'>Bullet</span> type.<br />For example, if a spell displays a final cost of 300 in a <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Programmer</span></a>, when copied into a <a href='#projectileBullet'><span class='color-item'>Projectile Spell Bullet</span></a> (with a <span class='color-thing'>Cost Multiplier</span> of 102%) it would have a true <a href='#tutorial5'><span class='color-thing'>Cost</span></a> of<br />300 × 102% = 306 <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span> per cast.<br /><br />
Many <span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullet</span> types introduce a delay between when the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> is cast, and when it actually gets executed.<br />Thus, it's important to note that the <a href='#tutorial5'><span class='color-thing'>Cost</span></a> of a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> being cast is paid upfront in full, and is non-refundable-- even if the <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span> in the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> aren't actually cast.<br /><br />
Every <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>, when cast, has a <span class='color-thing'>Focal Point</span>.<br />A <span class='color-thing'>Focal Point</span> is where the caster's <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span> is projected into the world (as one or more <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span>).<br />Of course, a <span class='color-thing'>Focal Point</span> can't execute any <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span> or evaluate any <span class='color-thing'>Selectors</span> from further than 32 blocks away (excepting those that affect its caster).<br />A <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> can access its <span class='color-thing'>Focal Point</span> using <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Focal Point</span>.<br /><br />
The location of a <span class='color-thing'>Focal Point</span> depends on the type of <span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullet</span> it's cast from.<br />The basic <a href='#basicBullet'><span class='color-item'>Spell Bullet</span></a>'s <span class='color-thing'>Focal Point</span> is simply the caster of the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>, but other types of <a href='#basicBullet'><span class='color-item'>Spell Bullet</span></a> can create different <span class='color-thing'>Focal Points</span>.<br />For example, a <a href='#projectileBullet'><span class='color-item'>Projectile Spell Bullet</span></a>'s <span class='color-thing'>Focal Point</span> is the projectile itself.<br />For more info on each <span class='color-thing'>Bullet</span> type's <span class='color-thing'>Focal Points</span> and quirks, consult individual entries.<br /><br />

The simplest type of <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullet</span></a> and (the namesake of the line of items), the humble <span class='color-item'>Spell Bullet</span> stores a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>.<br />When a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> stored in it is cast, it executes right away. The <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Focal Point</span></a> for this type of <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Bullet</span></a> is just the caster. Its cost of casting is exactly what the <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Spell Programmer</span></a> says it is.<br />No funny business here.<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='projectileBullet' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#projectileBullet' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='projectileBullet-fake'>Projectile Spell Bullet</b><div class='entry-text'>
A <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> cast from a <span class='color-item'>Projectile Spell Bullet</span> doesn't execute immediately.<br />Instead, a fast-moving <span class='color-thing'>Spell Projectile</span> containing it is fired out the end of the <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> from which it's cast.<br />This projectile acts as the <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Focal Point</span></a> for its <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>, executing it when the projectile collides with something.<br /><br />
A <span class='color-thing'>Spell Projectile</span> isn't physical; instead, it's a thin wrapper of <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span> around its contained <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> (hence the extra cost in the <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Bullet</span></a>).<br />As such, it can last for up to thirty seconds before dissipating.<br /><span class='color-thing'>Spell Projectiles</span> moves quite rapidly, and can travel more than 200 blocks' distance without assistance in their lifespan.<br /><br />
The projectile's stored <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> will activate if it collides with any blocks or entities.<br />In the case of the latter, <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Attack Target</span> can be used to identify the entity that was hit.<br />On the other hand, if the projectile hits <span class='mc-color-o'>nothing</span> in that time, the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> will fizzle, wasting the <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span> invested into it-- so aim carefully!<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='loopcastBullet' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#loopcastBullet' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='loopcastBullet-fake'>Loopcast Spell Bullet</b><div class='entry-text'>
A <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> cast from a <span class='color-item'>Loopcast Spell Bullet</span> is executed as if from a plain <a href='#basicBullet'><span class='color-item'>Spell Bullet</span></a>.<br />Repeatedly.<br />A <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> cast from one of these <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Bullets</span></a> is executed over and over nonstop, four times a second, until the <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> it was cast from stops being held in the same hand, or a different <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> is selected.<br /><br />
The <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Focal Point</span></a> for a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> cast from a <span class='color-item'>Loopcast Spell Bullet</span> is just the caster, and the full <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span> cost is incurred on each execution.<br />The major advantage of using one of these <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Bullets</span></a> over just casting repeatedly really fast lies in the <span class='mc-color-o'>regeneration</span> of your <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span>.<br /><br />
When you cast a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> (or when you take damage), your <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span> is momentarily left in a state of disequilibrium; it can't regenerate until you can focus inward and restabilize it.<br />While not difficult, this restabilization takes a bit of time to achieve.<br />But when you cast from a <span class='color-item'>Loopcast Spell Bullet</span>, this delay only occurs <span class='mc-color-o'>initially</span>-- afterwards, the <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Bullet</span></a> makes no disruptions in your <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span>, allowing it to regenerate as normal.<br /><br />
A <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> cast from one of these <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Bullets</span></a> can do different things on each invocation.<br />Specifically, <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Loopcast Index</span> returns the number of times the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> has been executed since you first cast it.<br />Thus, it returns 1 the first time the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> executes, 2 the second time, and so on.<br /><br />
When used with <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Integer Divide</span> and <span class='mc-color-b'>Operator: Modulus</span>, these <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Bullets</span></a> can perform operations <span class='mc-color-o'>en masse</span> over wide areas with ease.<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='circleBullet' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#circleBullet' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='circleBullet-fake'>Circle Spell Bullet</b><div class='entry-text'>
A <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> cast from a <span class='color-item'>Circle Spell Bullet</span> is executed consecutively exactly twenty times.<br />When the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> is first cast, a <span class='color-thing'>Spell Circle</span> is conjured at the point the caster is looking at, which acts as the <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Focal Point</span></a> for the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>. This circle executes the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> four times a second until it runs out of <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span>, five seconds later.<br /><br />
A <span class='color-thing'>Spell Circle</span>, when first cast, is conjured up to 32 blocks away from the caster's position or at the nearest block they look at (whichever is closer).<br />Similarly to a <a href='#loopcastBullet'><span class='color-item'>Loopcast Spell Bullet</span></a>, a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> cast from a <span class='color-thing'>Spell Circle</span> can know which iteration it's on using <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Loopcast Index</span> (which will return a number from 1 to 20, inclusive).<br /><br />
A <span class='color-thing'>Spell Circle</span> drains all the <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span> it needs when it's first cast, hence its <span class='color-thing'>Cost Multiplier</span> of a whopping 1500%.<br />However, its voracious <a href='#tutorial5'><span class='color-thing'>Cost</span></a> is not without benefit; its compact, self-contained design makes it <span class='mc-color-o'>extremely</span> efficient, allowing it to execute a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> 20 times for the cost of 15.<br />For those of you keeping track, that's a full 25% discount per-execution.<br /><br />
<span class='color-item'>Circle Spell Bullets</span> are quite popular among spellslingers new and experienced, both for their versatility and their conservation of <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span>.<br />As such, there are several relatively common tricks used with <span class='color-item'>Circle Spell Bullets</span> in particular that aren't seen elsewhere.<br /><br />
The <span class='color-thing'>Circlesync</span> idiom, quite simple to build, allows all twenty executions of the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> to happen at once, allowing them to accumulate into a much grander effect than a single execution would alone.<br />The <span class='color-thing'>20-Bit Tower</span> idiom has a slightly more difficult setup involving a <a href='#vectorRuler'><span class='color-item'>Vector Ruler</span></a>; but allows a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> to only do something on a subset of its twenty executions.<br /><br />
The <span class='color-thing'>Circlesync</span> idiom (pictured at right) uses <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Sleep</span> at its core.<br />When placed in the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>, it delays each execution corresponding exactly to the time left until the final <span class='color-thing'>Trick</span> activates.<br />Any <span class='color-thing'>Tricks</span> placed after the <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Sleep</span>, then, execute simultaneously.<br /><br />
The <span class='color-thing'>20-Bit Tower</span> idiom is a rather advanced technique, rather technical in design.<br />To use it, select a block with a <a href='#vectorRuler'><span class='color-item'>Vector Ruler</span></a>, then place some blocks (it doesn't matter what kind) in the twenty-block-high vertical space directly above the location you selected, then copy the code on the following page to the top of your <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>.<br /><br />
Each block position in that vertical space represents one execution of the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>; the bottommost location of the tower represents the first execution, the next location the second, and so on.<br />An empty space in a tower represents "<span class='mc-color-o'>DO</span> execute on that iteration," and a block in that position tells the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> "<span class='mc-color-o'>DON'T</span>."<br />Finally, copy the code on the next page to the top of your <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>.<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='grenadeBullet' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#grenadeBullet' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='grenadeBullet-fake'>Grenade Spell Bullet</b><div class='entry-text'>
A <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> cast from a <span class='color-item'>Grenade Spell Bullet</span>, instead of executing immediately, is fired out the end of the <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> it was cast in a <span class='color-thing'>Spell Grenade</span>.<br />Unlike a <a href='#projectileBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Projectile</span></a>, though, a grenade <span class='mc-color-o'>is</span> affected by gravity.<br />It executes its contained <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> after exactly three seconds, no sooner and no later.<br /><br />
A <span class='color-thing'>Spell Grenade</span> is an intangible thin wrapper of <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span>, created from the excess drawn by the <span class='color-item'>Grenade Spell Bullet</span>.<br />The conjured grenade also acts as the <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Focal Point</span></a> for the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> when it executes.<br />While its uses appear rather limited at first, a <span class='color-thing'>Spell Grenade</span> can reach places a <a href='#projectileBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Projectile</span></a> can't (e.g. over a wall, or inside a hole).<br /><br />
A <span class='color-thing'>Spell Grenade</span> will record the last entity it comes into contact with.<br />When its contained <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> executes, this entity can be accessed from <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Attack Target</span>, if applicable.<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='chargeBullet' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#chargeBullet' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='chargeBullet-fake'>Charge Spell Bullet</b><div class='entry-text'>
A <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> cast from a <span class='color-item'>Charge Spell Bullet</span>, rather than executing immediately, is fired out the end of the <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> it's cast from in a <span class='color-thing'>Spell Charge</span>, which obeys gravity just like a <a href='#grenadeBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Grenade</span></a>.<br />However, unlike a <a href='#grenadeBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Grenade</span></a>, a <span class='color-thing'>Spell Charge</span> can last up to five minutes, and only executes its <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> when specially told to do so by a <a href='#detonator'><span class='color-item'>Spell Detonator</span></a>.<br /><br />
A <span class='color-thing'>Spell Charge</span> is a stable shell of <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span> around its contained <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>, acting as the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>'s <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Focal Point</span></a> when executed.<br />If the <span class='color-thing'>Spell Charge</span> is never activated within its lifetime, it simply dissipates, fizzling the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> within and wasting the invested <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span>.<br /><br />
However, many <span class='color-thing'>Spell Charges</span> in close proximity can all be activated at once by a single <a href='#detonator'><span class='color-item'>Spell Detonator</span></a> (or <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Detonate</span>), making them quite useful for mass effect.<br />A <span class='color-thing'>Spell Charge</span> will record the last entity it bumps into (or, as may occur, the last entity to step on it).<br />When its contained <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> executes, this entity can be accessed from <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Attack Target</span>, if applicable.<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='mineBullet' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#mineBullet' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='mineBullet-fake'>Mine Spell Bullet</b><div class='entry-text'>
A <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> cast from a <span class='color-item'>Mine Spell Bullet</span> is fired out of the <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> it was cast in a <span class='color-thing'>Spell Mine</span>.<br />A <span class='color-thing'>Spell Mine</span> obeys gravity and has a five-minute lifespan, and only executes its stored <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> once stepped on by someone (or something).<br /><br />
A <span class='color-thing'>Spell Mine</span>'s conditions for execution are rather finicky; a mine begins by staying on the ground and waiting to be stepped on.<br />When one or more entities step on it, the mine doesn't trigger right away; instead it merely primes itself.<br />When it's primed and there are no longer any entities atop it, then and only then will it execute its contained <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>.<br /><br />
The entity that triggered the <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> (i.e. the last entity to step off the <span class='color-thing'>Spell Mine</span>) is accessible from <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Attack Target</span>.<br />However, if a <span class='color-thing'>Spell Mine</span>'s activation conditions are never met within its lifetime, the mine will simply dissipate, fizzling its stored energy.<br />So if you end up landing on a <span class='color-thing'>Spell Mine</span>, waiting it out might just be preferable to knowing what the caster has in store for you.<br /><br />

The suits' <span class='color-thing'>Spells</span> are cast with your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> as a focus, so the usual <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> limits apply.<br />Each piece of the <span class='color-thing'>Psimetal Exosuit</span> can be loaded with up to three <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullets</span></a> in a <a href='#cadAssembler'><span class='color-item'>CAD Assembler</span></a>, though sadly, some <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullet</span></a> variants don't play well with the suit.<br />A suit piece remembers the number of times it's successfully cast a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>; this count can be accessed from <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Success Counter</span>.<br /><br />
To select which <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> to use for a suit piece, craft an <span class='color-item'>Exosuit Controller</span> from <span class='color-item'>Redstone Dust</span>, <span class='color-item'>Glass</span>, and <a href='#psimetal'><span class='color-item'>Psimetal</span></a>. To use the <span class='color-item'>Controller</span>, hold the <span class='color-thing'>Psi master keybind</span> (c).<br />Use the right and left-mouse buttons to cycle through suit pieces.<br /><br />
Once you've selected the suit piece you want to configure, choose one of the <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullets</span></a> that's displayed the same way you would with your <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span>.<br />Selecting the empty fourth slot disables that suit piece completely-- no spells will be cast even if its activation criteria are met.<br /><br />
A <span class='color-thing'>Psimetal Exosuit</span> is slightly better than <span class='color-thing'>Iron Armor</span> in strength and durability.<br />All pieces of a suit will draw from their wearer's excess <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span> to repair damage to themselves, a feat made possible by the <a href='#psigem'><span class='color-item'>Psigems</span></a> used in their construction.<br /><br />
The <span class='color-item'>Psimetal Exosuit Helmet</span> is the most configurable of the bunch, casting its designated <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> whenever its contained <a href='#exosuitSensor'><span class='color-thing'>Exosuit Sensor</span></a> triggers.<br />A <a href='#exosuitSensor'><span class='color-thing'>Sensor</span></a> attaches to and detaches from a <span class='color-item'>Helmet</span> in a crafting grid; a <span class='color-item'>Helmet</span> can only have one <a href='#exosuitSensor'><span class='color-thing'>Exosuit Sensor</span></a> attached at a time.<br /><br />
The <span class='color-item'>Psimetal Exosuit Chestplate</span> casts its selected <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> whenever its user takes any form of damage.<br /><span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Attacker</span> and <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Damage Taken</span> can be used to identify the source and amount of damage, respectively.<br /><br />
<span class='color-item'>Psimetal Exosuit Leggings</span> <span class='mc-color-o'>never stop</span> casting their selected <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>.<br />In fact, they do so once per <span class='color-thing'>CAD</span> tick, which is a unit of time equal to 0.05 seconds.<br />They're quite popular as "better <a href='#loopcastBullet'><span class='color-item'>Loopcast Spell Bullets</span></a>."<br /><br />
<span class='color-item'>Psimetal Exosuit Boots</span> simply cast their designated <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> when their wearer jumps off the ground.<br />No more, no less.<br /><br />

All <span class='color-thing'>Sensors</span> are crafted from two <span class='color-item'>Iron Ingots</span> and two of a reagent around a <a href='#psimetal'><span class='color-item'>Psimetal</span></a> core; the reagent used determines the resulting <span class='color-thing'>Sensor</span>'s effect:<br /> &bull; the <span class='color-item'>Light Sensor</span> uses <span class='color-item'>Glowstone Dust</span>;<br /> &bull; the <span class='color-item'>Heat Sensor</span> uses <span class='color-item'>Fire Charges</span>;<br /> &bull; the <span class='color-item'>Stress Sensor</span> uses <span class='color-item'>Glistering Melons</span>;<br /> &bull; the <span class='color-item'>Water Sensor</span> uses <span class='color-item'>Prismarine Crystals</span>;<br /> &bull; the <span class='color-item'>Detonation Sensor</span> uses <span class='color-item'>TODO</span>.<br /><br />

The <span class='color-item'>Exosuit Heat Sensor</span> triggers whenever its wearer catches fire.<br /><span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Fire Resistance</span> or <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Torrent</span> are good responses to this <span class='color-thing'>Sensor</span> triggering, unless you <span class='mc-color-o'>really</span> know what you're doing.<br /><br />
The <span class='color-item'>Exosuit Stress Sensor</span> triggers when its wearer is low on health (specifically, if the wearer is at three hearts or less).<br /><span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Regeneration</span> might be a good response to this issue.<br /><br />
The <span class='color-item'>Exosuit Water Sensor</span> triggers when its wearer touches water.<br />With a bit of ingenuity, it can be triggered manually via <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Torrent</span>.<br /><br />
The <span class='color-item'>Exosuit Detonation Sensor</span> triggers whenever a <a href='#detonator'><span class='color-item'>Spell Detonator</span></a> is actuated within a 32-block radius, or when a <span class='mc-color-b'>Trick: Detonate</span> is cast in the same area.<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='tools' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#tools' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='tools-fake'>Psimetal Tools</b><div class='entry-text'>
The <span class='color-thing'>Psimetal Tools</span> are a set of tools, comparable to <span class='color-item'>Diamond</span>-tier in quality, each of which can cast a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> each time it performs its intended action.<br />All <span class='color-thing'>Psimetal Tools</span> are crafted with <span class='color-item'>Iron Ingots</span> in place of <span class='color-item'>Sticks</span>, one <a href='#psigem'><span class='color-item'>Psigem</span></a>, and some <a href='#psimetal'><span class='color-item'>Psimetal</span></a>.<br /><br />
A <span class='color-thing'>Psimetal Tool</span> can be loaded with up to three <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullets</span></a> in a <a href='#cadAssembler'><span class='color-item'>CAD Assembler</span></a> (though some <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullets</span></a> don't play well with the tools).<br />To select the <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullet</span></a> to use for a tool, hold the <span class='color-thing'>Psi master keybind</span> (c) and select from the menu as usual.<br />Picking an empty slot from the menu disables the tool from casting entirely.<br /><br />
All <span class='color-thing'>Psimetal Tools</span> except the <span class='color-item'>Psimetal Sword</span> cast their selected <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> once each time they break a block.<br />The <span class='color-item'>Sword</span> instead casts each time it hits a living being (though it should be noted for strategic purposes that once damaged, a living thing is invulnerable for half a second).<br /><span class='color-thing'>Psimetal Tools</span> will draw from their wielder's excess <span class='color-thing'>Psi energy</span> to repair themselves.<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='vectorRuler' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#vectorRuler' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='vectorRuler-fake'>Vector Ruler</b><div class='entry-text'>
A <span class='color-item'>Vector Ruler</span> can store an arbitrary vector, which can then be accessed from within a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> at your convenience.<br />It's made from <span class='color-item'>Iron Ingots</span> and a tip of <a href='#psidust'><span class='color-item'>Psidust</span></a>.<br /><br />
Tapping a <span class='color-item'>Ruler</span> on a block (Right Button) while crouching stores that block's position in the <span class='color-item'>Ruler</span> as a vector.<br />Once a block's position is stored, tapping the <span class='color-item'>Ruler</span> without crouching on another block will store the offset between the two blocks.<br />A <span class='color-item'>Ruler</span>'s stored vector can be accessed with <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Vector Ruler</span>.<br /><br />
If you happen to be carrying several <span class='color-item'>Rulers</span> at a time, <span class='mc-color-b'>Selector: Vector Ruler</span> will return the stored value of the leftmost <span class='color-item'>Ruler</span> in your hotbar, or the highest <span class='color-item'>Ruler</span> in your inventory if your hotbar has none.<br /><br />
</div><br><span id='spellDrive' class='bookmark-anchor'></span><a href='#spellDrive' class='entry-bookmark glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark' title='Permalink'></a> <b id='spellDrive-fake'>Spell Drive</b><div class='entry-text'>
A <span class='color-item'>Spell Drive</span>, crafted from two ingots of <a href='#psimetal'><span class='color-item'>Psimetal</span></a> and a piece of <span class='color-item'>Redstone Dust</span>, can store a single <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> for later use.<br />To store a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> in a <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Spell Programmer</span></a> onto a <span class='color-item'>Drive</span>, crouch and swipe (Right Button) an empty <span class='color-item'>Drive</span> over it.<br />To copy a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> back, crouch-swipe a <span class='color-item'>Drive</span> with a <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> stored over the <a href='#spellProgrammer'><span class='color-item'>Programmer</span></a>.<br /><br />
To clear a stored <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span>, crouch-swipe the <span class='color-item'>Drive</span> over any other block.<br />A <span class='color-item'>Drive</span> with a stored <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> can be placed in a crafting grid with an empty <span class='color-item'>Drive</span> or <a href='#spellBullet'><span class='color-thing'>Spell Bullet</span></a> to copy its <span class='color-thing'>Spell</span> onto the latter.<br /><br />
